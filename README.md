# YOLOv8 Traffic Object Detection Readme

This repository contains code to train a YOLOv8 model on the COCO dataset for the task of road traffic object detection and classification on a video clip. The aim is to identify and track objects such as cars, trucks, motorcycles, and buses in the video clip. The approach is based on the roboflow tutorial : https://colab.research.google.com/github/roboflow-ai/notebooks/blob/main/notebooks/how-to-track-and-count-vehicles-with-yolov8.ipynb?ref=roboflow-blog#scrollTo=Q9ppb7bFvWfc

## Dataset

The COCO dataset was used for training the model. The dataset is widely used for object detection tasks and contains annotations for a wide variety of objects, including those typically found in road traffic scenarios. The dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://cocodataset.org/#download.

## Method

The You Only Look Once version 8 (YOLOv8) object detection algorithm was used for this project. This algorithm is known for its high accuracy and fast processing speed, making it ideal for real-time object detection tasks. The YOLOv8 algorithm is based on a convolutional neural network architecture and uses a single neural network to predict bounding boxes and class probabilities directly from full images.
